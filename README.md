# Classes

This is a repository to document the work done in some of my university classes.

-   **Data Structures** - Labs and assignments from my data structures course implemented in both java and python
-   **Deep Learning** - Different assignments and models from my deep learning course using python and jupyter notebooks
-   **Intro to Game Design** - Homework assignments as well as a semester long project to develop a game done in javascript

# Wordle Royale

World Royale is a spin on the popular web-based word game [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle), where players get **6 chances** to guess a **5 letter word**.
After each guess, players are **given information via the color of the tile** around each letter of a guess.<br>
The tile colors and their meanings are as follows:

Green = Letter is **in the correct answer** and **in that position**<br>
Yellow = Letter is **in the correct answer** but **not that position**<br>
Gray = Letter is **not in the correct answer** at all

### What's Different?

Wordle Royale follows the same premise of the original wordle but with a twist. **Each guess** will either **reward** or **punish** the player by either **adding or removing the remaining guesses**. In addition, **word length is 6 letters** instead of 5 and the **starting number of guesses is 3** instead of 6.
