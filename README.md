# College Computer Science Classes

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document the assignments and projects from my various computer science classes at university. Below is a list of the classes and an overview of the topics covered in each:

-   [Algorithms](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/algorithms): This section contains implementations and analysis of different algorithms, such as Prim and Kruskal's algorithms, written in Java.

-   [Big Data Programming](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/big-data-programming): Here, you can find assignments exploring Hadoop and Apache Spark, which are used to handle the challenges of big data.

-   [Data Science](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/data-science): This section includes assignments and the technical final exam from my data science course. It covers a wide range of data science concepts such as linear and logistic regression, feature engineering, Bayesian classifiers, neural networks, and many more.

-   [Data Structures](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/data-structures): In this part, I have implemented various data structures, including stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, using both Java and Python.

-   [Databases Systems](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/databases): Here, you will find a deep exploration of core database concepts, including ER diagrams, relational models, relational algebra, SQL, normalization, indexing, and more. For the final project, I designed a database in BCNF based on the popular video game [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com).

-   [Deep Learning](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/deep-learning): This section focuses on the analysis of deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

-   [Intro to Game Design](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/gamedev): Here, you will find homework assignments as well as a [semester-long project](https://github.com/SisoroT/wordle-royale) in which I developed a game using JavaScript and HTML.

-   [Machine Learning](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/machine-learning): This section provides a comprehensive exploration of the core concepts of machine learning. It also includes a [project](https://github.com/SisoroT/stock-price-prediction) where I developed and compared different machine learning models for stock price prediction.

-   [Operating Systems](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/operating-systems): In this part, I implemented various operating system concepts, such as system calls, interrupts, and deadlocks.

-   [Web Programming](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/web-programming): This section analyzes the fundamentals of web programming, starting from basic static webpages and progressing to advanced libraries like Ajax and jQuery. It culminates in a solo project to develop an entire website hosted on AWS, which you can find [here](https://github.com/SisoroT/recipe-collection).
