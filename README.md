# Classes

This is a repository to document the work done in some of my university classes.

- **Data Structures** - Labs and assignments from my data structures course implemented in both java and python
- **Deep Learning** - Different assignments and models from my deep learning course using python and jupyter notebooks
- **Intro to Game Design** - Homework assignments as well as a semester long project to develop a game done in javascript

The game design project will have it's own section once completed
