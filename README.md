This is a repository to document the work done in some of my university classes.

- [Data Structures](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/datastructures) - Labs and assignments from my data structures course implemented in both java and python
- [Deep Learning](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/deep-learning) - Different assignments and models from my deep learning course using python and jupyter notebooks
- [Intro to Game Design](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/gamedev) - Homework assignments as well as a semester long project to develop a game done in javascript

The **game** design project will have it's own section once completed
