# Classes

This is a repository to document the work done in some of my university classes.

-   [Algorithms](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/algorithms) - Analysis of different algorithms like **Prim and Kruskal's** done in java
-   [Big Data Programming](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/big-data-programming) - Assignments that explore both **Hadoop and Apache Spark** to break down and handle the problem of big data
-   [Data Science](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/data-science) - Assignments and the final from my data science course that explore numerous **data science concepts** such as **linear and logistic regression, feature engineering, bayesian classifiers, neural networks, and much more**
-   [Data Structures](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/data-structures) - Implementation of the different data structures such as **stacks, queues, trees, and graphs** completed in both **java and python**
-   [Deep Learning](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/deep-learning) - Analysis of **deep learning models** such as **CNNs and RNNs** using **python** and **jupyter notebooks**
-   [Intro to Game Design](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/gamdev) - Homework assignments as well as a [semester long project to develop a game](https://github.com/SisoroT/wordle-royale) done in **javascript and html**
-   [Operating Systems](https://github.com/SisoroT/classes/tree/main/operating-systems) - Implementation of operating systems concepts such as **system calls, interrupts, and deadlocks**
